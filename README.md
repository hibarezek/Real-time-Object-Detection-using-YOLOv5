Real-time Object Detection with YOLO
This repository contains a Python project for real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The implementation is based on the YOLOv5 model from Ultralytics.

Overview
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video stream. YOLO is a popular deep learning-based approach for real-time object detection.

This project provides a real-time object detection pipeline using YOLOv5 model to detect objects from a webcam feed. Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with their corresponding class names and confidence scores.

Features
Real-time object detection using webcam feed.
Bounding boxes visualization with class names and confidence scores.
Customizable model selection and confidence threshold.
